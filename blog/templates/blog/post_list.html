            <p>In the first few weeks of the semester I was completely overwhelmed with the language of code. Having little-to-no prior familiarity with programing and code languages, I began the lectures and tutorials slightly intimidated by the expectations of the semester. However, I realised most of my class were in the same boat and through class discussion we began to conceptualise the potential of coding. Ford (2015) informs us that the internet and its capabilities can do so much more and so much faster than a person with a single pen and paper. An idea similarly taken by Barnet (2013) who refers to a concept of ‘Xanadu’ the magical place of literary memory a computer is capable of (p. 66).  From what I understood, coding is a way for us to tell a machine to do something, and the possibilities of this can be somewhat endless. Ford refers to the code as the ‘art’ (2015), the art we use to make something ‘cool’ or exciting happen on any machine, a way for us to talk to technology such as a computer, phone, the internet, etc.  </p>

<p>In the first lecture we were encouraged that one of the main ways of learning and understanding code was “by doing”. This did not mean we were going to become extreme programmers by the end of the course, but gain a code literacy by getting our hands dirty. For this semester I decided I was going to build an interactive fiction game, I was inspired by previous work submitted into a student magazine Voiceworks, that was linked to us by the subject co-ordinator. I found this magazine and its entries inspiring because they used code to make artefacts that appealed to other students with relatable poetry, stories and art. </p>

<p>One in particular was an interactive fiction called Slumtree (2017) by Tara Kenny and Rachel Ang, a choose your own adventure story about the good and bad experiences living in shared housing. In this story and other interactive fictions they can do more than simply printing words onto a page in a book. With code they construct a range of pathways for how a story may lead creating a different and new experience for each reader. </p>

<p>Here lies the key goal I am setting myself for the semester, to develop my code literacy by making an interactive fiction where I can construct a story that requires the readers involvement by more than simply reading words on a page. ‘The problem with paper is that every sentence wants to break out and slither in some other direction, but the confines of the page forbid us to’ (Barnet, p.69 2013). The art of code can enable a new way of experiencing a story that can only happen outside of a piece of paper. </p>

            <h2><a href="">My second post</a></h2>
             <p>If I were to describe my journey of understanding code so far, I would define it as a one step forward two steps back scenario. This week after constant trial and error and typing countless commands into my terminal I finally got my Django blog running… Success! I discovered errors were not always a bad thing and when something went wrong in the command line it would somewhat explain what was going wrong. I would work around this issue by bouncing between suggestions on the DSM blog and Django girls tutorial.</p>

<p>Setting up this blog has taught me a lot so far about the way my computer runs. I have learnt that when I run a site on my computer it is following a pathway into a database/ server that contains a file, this file is filled with all the things I am hoping to receive. ‘A website consists of a bunch of files saved on a hard disk, and these files include computer code called HTML’(Django Girls 2018), Shuler (2002) defines HTML as the language used to write web pages. Following the tutorials to make the Django blog I was making these files that I could later ask my computer to serve me and run. </p>

<p>My code literacy prior to this course and the way I viewed the internet and my computer were similar to what Ford (2015) refers to as, ‘code can be a black box, with tentacles and wires that stick out and you don’t need to look inside’. I could type in a URL into my web browser and somehow the webpage I needed would come up, but I wouldn’t think twice about how it got there. Now after developing some code literacy, when I use a URL address or send an email to another computer I know I am ‘communicating within a web network and the connection is staying open over the internet’ (Shuler 2002).</p>

<p>Despite understanding what the internet is doing and this web of servers feeding us data, there is still so much I do not understand about coding. I was able to read the online tutorials  copying each command line on my terminal to get my blog running. Yet, errors still occurred along the way that left me confused and stuck and a lot of time it felt like a game of copy and paste. For example, after thinking I had installed Django correctly I found an error continue to show up “no matching distribution found for Django”. Without the DSM blog page giving us a trouble shooting command “curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py”, I would not have known how to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>Even though I may not understand what every little line of code or command really means, it is my overall understanding of the internet that has improved so far into the course. Shuler (2002) provides an in-depth explanation of how the internet works, yet he also argues that ‘the Internet will unite the world like no other mechanism ever has and the Information Age is in full stride’(Shuler 2002). This confidence in the possibility of what code can do has broadened my code literacy to thinking of thing like my computer as more than just a little black box. </p>

            <h2><a href="">My third post</a></h2>
             <p>Finally now that my Django blog is set up and running, this week it was time to get refocused on building my interactive fiction/ text based game artefact. At this stage in the semester I am feeling comfortable with python code and writing it into sublime text, however I still looked into online tutorials as a guide to get my interactive fiction going. </p>

<p>Despite the internet having stacks of code already written out there it is not as simple as copying and pasting relevant code and hoping my project will come to life. When following a YouTube tutorial I began using this guided code almost word for word, yet came to the realisation even the first line had a syntax error and would need to be edited. </p>

<p>Tutorial code read: </p>
<p>Print “welcome to my game”</p>
<p>What the code should have included:</p>
<p>Print (“welcome to my game”)</p>

<p>What seems like the smallest error now (and only in the first line!) had me stuck for at least 20min and it was only forgetting a pair of brackets. The main point here for me, as I also discovered last week is that code really is a system of trial and error. Small things like spelling mistakes or syntax errors are not forgiving and for a machine to read your code it needs to be completely debugged. There is definitely no colouring outside the lines! However, after finally getting the hang of things again the project started coming along smoothly with making sure all the correct spelling and syntax were in place. </p>

<p>Streeter discusses the evolution of the digital world and how it was ‘the wave of the future’ (2005, p.756). In doing so he highlights the impact the internet and computers had on differing social classes and how this has impacted the design and discussion about technology today. Starting with the small community of computer engineers in the 1970’s developing computers through a lens that echoed the of counterculture of  the 1960’s, to the white collar workers in the 1990’s sitting in cubicles of offices quietly discovering the thrills of going ‘online’ (Streeter 2005, p.771). The spreading of computer technology in the ‘counter culture’ or ‘middle ranks’ gave an interesting impact to the way the digital world was designed and is discussed today. </p>

<p>This reading by Streeter made me consider the reasoning behind the concept of my artefact assignment. I wanted to build an interactive fiction that was based on the current online dating world. In this way I am using technology to respond to the society we are living in. Even though my story is fairly basic and I am no computer programmer, it is an example of how cultural surroundings can influence ideas. As a result people can produce digital artefacts that are a response to their current world. </p>

<p>I still have some progress to make with my dating story/ interactive fiction for the next coming weeks. I have realised that most interactive fictions I’ve read online were using a story building website such as ‘Twine’ or ‘Quest’. I had a quick play with these sites however they were not using python code and would be more useful if I was more focused on the actual narrative than learning the code. For this reason, I will stick to making my text based game in python, however it will be less wordy and detailed as I first anticipated. </p>

            <h2><a href="">My fourth post</a></h2>
             <p>It is now the second last week of the semester and I have been able to develop two completed artefacts built with my own code. The first being my Django blog and the second my text based/ fiction game. Aspects from first creating my blog and later coming to my artefact has benefitted my development of code literacy. Creating the blog taught me a lot about how my computer works and getting comfortable with typing commands into terminal. When writing my fiction artefact into sublime text I would run tests though my terminal with the following commands:</p>

<p>$ cd desktop (as I saved the file on my desktop)</p>
<p>$ python3 quiz.py (the name of my file)</p>

<p>This would then let me see what code I had written/ what was working and where the errors so far were coming up. Mostly my errors would be syntax, for example leaving out ‘:’ after some of the ‘if’, ‘elif’ and ‘else’ statements. Terminal would tell me which line the syntax error occurred in sublime text and from there it would be an easy fix. </p>

<p> I mainly reffered to two tutorials to start the development of my coding artefact, the first was a webpage ‘Multiple Choice Quiz using Python’ by Tech Teachers (2015), and a youtube tutorial ‘ASMR how to program a text adventure’ by _asmr4u_(2017), unfortunately I am not a big fan of the ASMR trend, yet I found both these tutorial’s easy to follow for getting my head around the basics. The Teach Teachers (2015) tutorial for example encouraged the use of a flowchart/ mindmap to start with before actually getting into the code, so that you could see the outcome of where you wanted the story to go. Last week I had previously put my story into the interactive fiction generator ‘Twine’, that had already portrayed my story as a mind map and helped me to guide my code when I transferred the story into python. </p>

<p>The _asmr4u_ (2012) tutorial was helpful for explaining again the process of setting up my own ‘def’ functions and variables. I ended up with defining five different functions: def intro (), def start(), def inside(), def gameplay() and def selectchoice(). After each function I would ‘print’ statements that were the body of my story, then I would set up choices that would allow different pathways to choose from and different functions to come to play. </p>

<p>What I realised is that my game could potentially be endless, and if I wanted I could keep defining new parts of the story that would take my reader to new choices. This was because most of the code was essentially the same and I would only be repeating a few lines making changes to the else, elif and if statements where necessary. Even though the code a lot of the time was similar I believe my code literacy has progressed as I understand how to use different commands to make my computer do something. This came as a result both in my fiction and completing the Django blog.  </p>

            <h2><a href="">My fifth post</a></h2>
            <p>A few weeks ago I tested deploying my blog posts onto GitHub and python anywhere and successfully managed to have my own personal blog webpage anyone could access. However, my blog posts where not yet completed as the overall project was still in progress. This week now that all is complete I have been struggling to update the code I already uploaded onto GitHub that will show my last few posts. I was testing whether I could update the code before finishing this final blog as I knew it needed to have all this content for submission. </p>

<p>After feeling as though I had accomplished so much this far in the semester with my code literacy, this should have been easy - right? I was managing to update my original .html file in GitHub, however these changes would not make a difference to my pythonanywhere webpage as it would not simultaneously update. When this issue arose I decided to head back to the Djangogirls tutorial site hoping I could backtrack and figure out what I needed to do to make these updates. What seems to always be my problem is a simple syntax error, in the python anywhere command like I was pasting the following line and continuing to be faced with error: </p>
<p>pa_autoconfigure_django.py https://github.com/< your-github-username >/my-first-blog.git</p>

<p>Where I would insert < margiegray > inside the brackets. The issue here was that I had to remove the ‘<’,’>’ brackets completely inserting margiegray, and finally my site was being updated again. </p>

<p>Coming to the end of the course and reflecting on what we have learnt, I believe that this subject was not about making us “professional programmers” as such, but teaching us to be comfortable reading and understanding code that is already out there. This includes being able to access libraries and resources of code or steps to making code that people have already written and shared. Django girls as an example, has helped me learn so much about code literacy by simply following tutorial steps. </p>

<p>What I learnt about Django Girls is that it is a non-profit organisation that contributes to bring more women into the world of technology (Django Girls 2018). This does not mean you have to be only female to follow tutorials set up by the organisation but it does highlight that programming is not just a male dominant industry. In week 9, we discussed the topic of code and gender. Light (1999) discusses how women during WWII were learning the skills of transferring information to computers, what we know as programmers today (p.462). He further describes how women in their work as operators moved into stereotypical male domains playing a subversive role. However, the invisibility of women in historical accounts reflects ambivalence about these roles women professionals occupied in the labour force (Light 1999, p.482). </p>

<p>Even though programing may be considered a more masculine profession today, the historical accounts discussed by Light prove that women can be equally associated with these skills. Spending so much time on the Django Girls tutorials became an inspiring process for me with my code development. I was able to reshape this commonly perceived notion that computing, programming and coding is something to be mainly considered masculine as the site I was using for guidance aims to highlight the work of female programmers. </p>
