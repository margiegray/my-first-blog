            <p>In the first few weeks of the semester I was completely overwhelmed with the language of code. Having little-to-no prior familiarity with programing and code languages, I began the lectures and tutorials slightly intimidated by the expectations of the semester. However, I realised most of my class were in the same boat and through class discussion we began to conceptualise the potential of coding. Ford informs us that the internet and its capabilities can do so much more and so much faster than a person with a single pen and paper (2015). An idea similarly taken by Nelson who refers to his concept of ‘Xanadu’ the magical place of literary memory a computer is capable of (Barnet, 2013).  From what I understood, coding is a way for us to tell a machine to do something, and the possibilities of this can be somewhat endless. Ford refers to the code as the ‘art’ (2015), the art we use to make something ‘cool’ happen on any machine such as a computer, phone, the internet, etc.  </p>
<p>
In the first lecture we were encouraged that one of the main ways of learning and understanding code was “by doing”. This did not mean we were going to become extreme programmers by the end of the course, but gain a code literacy by getting our hands dirty. For this semester I decided I was going to build an interactive fiction game, I was inspired by previous work submitted into a student magazine Voiceworks. I found this magazine and its entries inspiring because they used code to make artefacts that appealed to other students with relatable poetry, stories and art. 
</p>
<p>
One in particular was an interactive fiction called Slumtree by Tarry Kenny and Rachel Ang, a choose your own adventure story about the good and bad experiences living in shared housing. In this story and other interactive fictions they can do more than simply printing words onto a page in a book. With code they construct a range of pathways for how a story may lead creating a different and new experience for each reader. Here lies the key goal I am setting myself for the semester, to develop my code literacy by making an interactive fiction where I can construct a story that recquires the readers involvement by more than simply reading words on a page. ‘The problem with paper is that every sentence wants to break out and slither in some other direction, but the confines of the page forbid us to’ (Barnet, p.69 2013). </p>

            <h2><a href="">My second post</a></h2>
             <p>published: 14.06.2014, 12:14</p>
            <p>If I were to describe my journey of understanding code so far, I would define it as a one step forward two steps back scenario. This week after constant trial and error and typing countless commands into my terminal I finally got my Django blog running… Success! I discovered errors were not always a bad thing and when something went wrong in the command line it would somewhat explain what was going wrong. I would work around this issue by bouncing between suggestions on the DSM blog and Django girls tutorial.</p>

<p>Setting up this blog has taught me a lot so far about the way my computer runs. I have learnt that when I run a site on my computer it is following a pathway into a database/ server that contains a file, this file is filled with all the things I am hoping to receive. ‘A website consists of a bunch of files saved on a hard disk, and these files include computer code called HTML’(Django girls), Shuler (2002) defines HTML as the language used to write web pages. Following the tutorials to make the Django blog I was making these files that I could later ask my computer to serve me and run. </p>

<p>My code literacy prior to this course and the way I viewed the internet and my computer were similar to what Ford (2015) refers to as, ‘code can be a black box, with tentacles and wires that stick out and you don’t need to look inside’. I could type in a URL into my web browser and somehow the webpage I needed would come up, but I wouldn’t think twice about how it got there. Now after developing some code literacy, when I use a URL address or send an email to another computer I know I am ‘communicating within a web network and the connection is staying open over the internet’ (Shuler 2002).</p>

<p>Despite understanding what the internet is doing and this web of servers feeding us data, there is still so much I do not understand about coding. I was able to read the online tutorials  copying each command line on my terminal to get my blog running. Yet, errors still occurred along the way that left me confused and stuck and a lot of time it felt like a game of copy and paste. For example, after thinking I had installed Django correctly I found an error continue to show up “no matching distribution found for Django”. Without the DSM blog page giving us a trouble shooting command “curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py”, I would not have known how to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>Even though I may not understand what every little line of code or command really means, it is my overall understanding of the internet that has improved so far into the course. Shuler (2002) provides an in-depth explanation of how the internet works, yet he also argues that ‘the Internet will unite the world like no other mechanism ever has and the Information Age is in full stride’(Shuler 2002). This confidence in the possibility of what code can do has broadened my code literacy to thinking of thing like my computer as more than just a little black box. </p>

            <p> Finally now that my Django blog is set up and running, this week it was time to get refocused on building my interactive fiction artefact. At this stage in the semester I am feeling comfortable with python code and writing it into sublime text, however I still looked into online tutorials as a guide to get my interactive fiction going. 
Despite the internet having stacks of code already written out there it is not as simple as copying and pasting relevant code and hoping my project will come to life. When following a youtube tutorial by …. I began using this guided code almost word for word, yet came to the realisation even the first line had a syntax error and would need to be edited. 

Tutorial code read: 
Print “welcome to my quiz”
What the code should have included:
Print (“welcome to my quiz”)

What seems like the smallest error now (and only in the first line!) had me stuck for at least 20min and it was only forgetting a pair of brackets. The main point here for me, as I also discovered last week is that code really is a system of trial and error. Small things like spelling mistakes or syntax errors are not forgiving and for a machine to read your code it needs to be completely debugged. There is definitely no colouring outside the lines!  

Discusses the evolution of the internet and computers and how social classes, and the current cultural landscape gave impact into the design and the discussion about how the technology was changing (find reference) 
 During the 1970s, in sum, a small community of computer engineers and tinkerers was envisioning comput- ers through lenses that had at least echoes of the counterculture; this then provided a set of ideas and tropes that were available to be picked up by the larger culture and made into a vehicle for promoting new meanings, new habits of talk and actio 167
By May 1993, white-collar workers in cubicles and offices across the land were quietly discovering the thrills of going online 771
spreading the tropes of the computer counterculture to the middle ranks. 
That anyone has the potential to build something exciting. Interesting that the history and ecolution of the internet and code can teach us this. White collar people accessing ht einternet and learning new things, inspiring ideas off the mainstream, but resulting as ecolivationary.

            <h2><a href="">My fourth post</a></h2>
             <p>published: 14.06.2014, 12:14</p>
            <p>It is now the second last week of the semester and I have been able to develop two completed artefacts built with my own code. The first being my Django blog and the second my text based/ fiction game. Aspects from first creating my blog and later coming to my artefact has benefitted my development of code literacy. Creating the blog taught me a lot about how my computer works and getting comfortable with typing commands into terminal. When writing my fiction artefact into sublime text I would run tests though my terminal with the following commands:</p>

<p>$ cd desktop (as I saved the file on my desktop)</p>
<p>$ python3 quiz.py (the name of my file)</p>

<p>This would then let me see what code I had written/ what was working and where the errors so far were coming up. Mostly my errors would be syntax, for example leaving out ‘:’ after some of the ‘if’, ‘elif’ and ‘else’ statements. Terminal would tell me which line the syntax error occurred in sublime text and from there it would be an easy fix. </p>

<p>To get the main functions in my artefact running I watched the tutorial “ASMR how to program a text adventure” by _asmr4u_(2017), unfortunately I am not a big fan of the ASMR trend, yet I found this tutorial was easy to follow for getting my head around the basics. This included setting up my own ‘def’ functions and variables. I ended up with defining four different functions: def start(), def inside(), def gameplay() and def selectchoice(). After each function I would ‘print’ statements that were the body of my story, then I would set up choices that would allow different pathways to choose from and different functions to come to play. </p>

<p>What I realised is that my game could potentially be endless, and if I wanted I could keep defining new parts of the story that would take my reader to new choices. This was because most of the code was essentially the same and I would only be repeating a few lines making changes to the else, elif and if statements where necessary. Even the code a lot of the time was similar I believe my code literacy has progressed as I understand how to use different commands to make my computer do something. This came as a result both in my fiction and completing the Django blog.  </p>
