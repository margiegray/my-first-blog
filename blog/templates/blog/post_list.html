            <p>In the first few weeks of the semester I was completely overwhelmed with the language of code. Having little-to-no prior familiarity with programing and code languages, I began the lectures and tutorials slightly intimidated by the expectations of the semester. However, I realised most of my class were in the same boat and through class discussion we began to conceptualise the potential of coding. Ford informs us that the internet and its capabilities can do so much more and so much faster than a person with a single pen and paper (2015). An idea similarly taken by Nelson who refers to his concept of ‘Xanadu’ the magical place of literary memory a computer is capable of (Barnet, 2013).  From what I understood, coding is a way for us to tell a machine to do something, and the possibilities of this can be somewhat endless. Ford refers to the code as the ‘art’ (2015), the art we use to make something ‘cool’ happen on any machine such as a computer, phone, the internet, etc.  
<p>
In the first lecture we were encouraged that one of the main ways of learning and understanding code was “by doing”. This did not mean we were going to become extreme programmers by the end of the course, but gain a code literacy by getting our hands dirty. For this semester I decided I was going to build an interactive fiction game, I was inspired by previous work submitted into a student magazine Voiceworks. I found this magazine and its entries inspiring because they used code to make artefacts that appealed to other students with relatable poetry, stories and art. 
<p>
One in particular was an interactive fiction called Slumtree by Tarry Kenny and Rachel Ang, a choose your own adventure story about the good and bad experiences living in shared housing. In this story and other interactive fictions they can do more than simply printing words onto a page in a book. With code they construct a range of pathways for how a story may lead creating a different and new experience for each reader. Here lies the key goal I am setting myself for the semester, to develop my code literacy by making an interactive fiction where I can construct a story that recquires the readers involvement by more than simply reading words on a page. ‘The problem with paper is that every sentence wants to break out and slither in some other direction, but the confines of the page forbid us to’ (Barnet, p.69 2013).

            <p>My experience with code so far has definitely been feeling like a one step forward two steps back scenario. For example, whilst creating my Django blog my patience was definitely tested. How could I possibly be running into error after error in my terminal when I was following the DSM code webpage/ Django Girls steps word for word?. After almost giving up and despite this frustrating process seeing the blog appear for the first time and being able to submit my blog posts on this site is definitely a rewarding feeling and makes you believe hard work can really pay off. This for me is a key point I have learnt about coding so far in the course. Code really is about trial and error. 
<p>
Errors are not always a bad thing. Infact most of what I have learnt so far is because an error came up and I had to work around in.

            <p> Finally now that my Django blog is set up and running, this week it was time to get refocused on building my interactive fiction artefact. At this stage in the semester I am feeling comfortable with python code and writing it into sublime text, however I still looked into online tutorials as a guide to get my interactive fiction going. 
Despite the internet having stacks of code already written out there it is not as simple as copying and pasting relevant code and hoping my project will come to life. When following a youtube tutorial by …. I began using this guided code almost word for word, yet came to the realisation even the first line had a syntax error and would need to be edited. 

Tutorial code read: 
Print “welcome to my quiz”
What the code should have included:
Print (“welcome to my quiz”)

What seems like the smallest error now (and only in the first line!) had me stuck for at least 20min and it was only forgetting a pair of brackets. The main point here for me, as I also discovered last week is that code really is a system of trial and error. Small things like spelling mistakes or syntax errors are not forgiving and for a machine to read your code it needs to be completely debugged. There is definitely no colouring outside the lines!  

Discusses the evolution of the internet and computers and how social classes, and the current cultural landscape gave impact into the design and the discussion about how the technology was changing (find reference) 
 During the 1970s, in sum, a small community of computer engineers and tinkerers was envisioning comput- ers through lenses that had at least echoes of the counterculture; this then provided a set of ideas and tropes that were available to be picked up by the larger culture and made into a vehicle for promoting new meanings, new habits of talk and actio 167
By May 1993, white-collar workers in cubicles and offices across the land were quietly discovering the thrills of going online 771
spreading the tropes of the computer counterculture to the middle ranks. 
That anyone has the potential to build something exciting. Interesting that the history and ecolution of the internet and code can teach us this. White collar people accessing ht einternet and learning new things, inspiring ideas off the mainstream, but resulting as ecolivationary.
